<h2>Everyone deserves to have their face on a billboard</h2>
<p>So, thanks to UK, I've had the opportunity to see my face on a billboard. It was strange and unexpected, but my mom got really excited about it. The response that it has received leads me to believe that people generally like to see their faces really large on a public display. This is what has inspired me to create <em>Faces of Lexington</em>.</p>
<h3>Quick specs:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Similar to Chicago's <a href="http://www.cirrusimage.com/chicago_crown_fountain.htm">Crown Fountain</a></li>
<li>Displays photos or videos of the faces of everyday people in Lexington</li>
<li>Located on the side of the Community Ventures building across from the upcoming Isaac Murphy Memorial Art Garden</li>
</ul>
